# Zoink!

# Welcome to Zoink Programming Language!

Zoink is an expressive, high-performance programming language built in Zig, inspired by the Monkey language in the book ["Creating an Interpreter in Go."](https://interpreterbook.com/)

## Getting Started

To begin using Zoink, make sure you have Zig installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1. Install Zig from the [official website](https://ziglang.org/download/).
2. Clone the Zoink repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/zoink-lang.git`.
3. Build the Zoink interpreter: `cd zoink-lang && zig build`.

## Hello World in Zoink

Create a file called `hello.zoink` and add the following code:

```
println("Hello, World!");
```

Run your program with:

```bash
./zoink hello.zoink
```

Expect the classic "Hello, World!" output as Zoink warmly greets you.
